<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>Andrew Hozier-Byrne was born on March 17, 1990 in Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland. The son of a local blues musician, he joined his first band when he was 15, gravitating toward R&B, 
soul, gospel, and, of course, blues. Citing James Joyce's Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man, Leonard Cohen, John Lee Hooker, and community choral singing among his influences, Hozier 
started studying for a degree in music at Trinity College Dublin, where he was involved with the Trinity Orchestra, but dropped out in his first year to record demos for Universal Music. 
From 2009 to 2012, he sang with An√∫na, an Irish choral group, and toured internationally.</p>
<p>He released a solo EP, Take Me to Church, in 2013 using his stage name Hozier, and when a video 
for the powerful title track, which directly addresses gay discrimination in the Catholic Church, went viral on YouTube and Reddit, he found himself with an international audience. 
A second EP, From Eden, appeared in the spring of 2014 and in September of that year, Columbia released his eponymous debut album.</p>
